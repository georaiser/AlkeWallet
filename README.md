 # AlkeWallet

AlkeWallet is a robust Spring Boot application that simulates a digital wallet system with advanced financial management capabilities. This project showcases the implementation of a secure, scalable, and feature-rich banking solution using modern Java technologies.

## 🌟 Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login system with role-based access control (ADMIN and USER roles).
- **Account Management**: Create, view, and manage multiple account types (CHECKING, SAVING).
- **Transaction Processing**: Support for deposits, withdrawals, and inter-account transfers.
- **Client Management**: CRUD operations for client information.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Centralized management interface for system administrators.
- **Transaction History**: Detailed logs of all financial transactions.
- **Security**: Implements Spring Security with custom UserDetailsService and BCrypt password encoding.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java 11+, Spring Boot 3.x
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: Hibernate (Spring Data JPA)
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf (implied from controller return statements)
- **Build Tool**: Maven (inferred from project structure)

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic and transaction management.
3. **Repository Layer**: Data access and persistence.
4. **Security Layer**: Authentication, authorization, and access control.

## `🔑` Key Components

1. **SecurityConfig**: Configures Spring Security, defining access rules and authentication mechanisms.
2. **CustomUserDetailsService**: Implements UserDetailsService for database-backed user authentication.
3. **AccountService**: Manages account-related operations including balance updates and transfers.
4. **TransactionService**: Handles and logs all financial transactions.
5. **DataInitializer**: Bootstraps the application with initial roles and users.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlkeWallet.git

2. Configure MySQL database in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

- spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/AlkeWallet
- spring.datasource.username=root
- spring.datasource.password=Admin2024

3. Build and run the application:

- ./mvnw spring-boot:run

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

## 👥 Default Users

- Admin: `username: admin, password: admin`
- User: `username: user, password: user`

## 🔒 Security Implementation

- BCrypt password encoding
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Custom access denied handler
- Secure session management

## 🗄 Database Schema

The application uses MySQL with Hibernate's `ddl-auto=update` for schema generation. Key entities include:

- User
- Role
- Account
- Client
- Transaction

## 🌐 API Endpoints

- `/login`: Authentication
- `/accounts/*`: Account management
- `/clients/*`: Client operations
- `/transactions/*`: Transaction processing and history
- `/adminWallet`: Admin dashboard

## 🧪 Testing

[Add information about your testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and how to run them]

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Uses Spring Data JPA for efficient database operations
- Implements proper transaction management for data integrity

## 🛡 Security Best Practices

- Implements HTTPS (to be configured in production)
- Uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implements CSRF protection
- Secure password storage using BCrypt

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

1. Implement multi-factor authentication
2. Add support for international transactions
3. Integrate with external payment gateways
4. Develop a mobile application for the wallet system
